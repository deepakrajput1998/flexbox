        plant was explained by the supervisor in detail. The first unit for the treatment process is the sedimentation tank and the flocculator. 
        There were 9 units of Sedimentation Tank and 12 units of flocculator. There were 6 pedals each 6 ft. wide and 22 ft. deep weighing 12 kg in the flocculator. Addition of Alum was only done during monsoon season, otherwise the flocculator works as a sedimentation tank. After the flocculation tank the water reaches to the slow and rapid sand filter tank. There are 06 filter units each 25 ft. deep. The filter unit consists of a fine sand layer, coarse sand level and gravel level each layer 1 ft. deep. There were 4 Rapid sand filters and 2 slow sand filters. In every 4- 5 hours, backwashing is done for 30 min. After the filtration process, Chlorination is done. Normally 500 gm chlorine per hour in the form of liquid gas was added. But as the turbidity increases, they increase the chlorine dose. In monsoon, this dose can be increased to 5000 gm per hour. The maintenance work of this treatment plant is done yearly 
        before monsoon and the treatment plant shuts down for 10-15 days for maintenance. There were two other treatment plants lying besides this one having the capacity of 45 MLD.
